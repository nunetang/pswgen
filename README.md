## Description

This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character type:

  * Special characters 

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters

The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.

The user should also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.
